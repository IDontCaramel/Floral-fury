Welcome to Floral Fury, an exciting top-down shooter game created for a school project! This game was a collaborative effort between myself and ([Cas](http://portfolio.casvld.nl/)). Despite our tight deadline of two weeks, we made a great game, though there might be a few bugs lurking about.

# Gameplay

In Floral Fury, your objective is simple yet thrilling: gather as many points as possible! Points are earned by skillfully taking down enemy units. As you accumulate points, unlock various upgrades to enhance your arsenal.
Features

    Dynamic Maps: Explore three unique maps, each with distinct aesthetics and enemy spawn points. The thrill of discovery awaits!
    Upgrade System: Strategically choose your upgrades to suit your playstyle. Will you focus on firepower, speed, or defense?
    Multiple Enemy Types: Encounter a variety of enemies, each with unique attack patterns and behaviors. From fast-moving scouts to heavily armored brutes, be prepared for anything!
